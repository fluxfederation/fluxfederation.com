                        <h2>People. Power. Possibility.</h2>
                        <p><strong>People</strong> are at the heart of everything we do. For real. The Flux crew is vital to the success of our platform, our products and our company. They're what makes Flux, well, Flux. We work together to discover new ways people can experience energy, sharing our knowledge and expertise with each other to truly build and design an energy experience like no other. We work hard, but we play hard. When you're a part of Flux, you become part of a wide family of pool-playing, footy-loving, netball-supporting, music-making polymaths who ensure there's never a dull moment.</p>
                        <p>Yes, <strong>power</strong> is what we do as a business, but we also believe in empowering people. When customers can access their own power, great things happen. This is why we're committed to giving our clients and their customers the ability to manage their power themselves. We make the whole process transparent and easy, unlike any other energy experience out there. </p>
                        <p>The future is what we make of it. Flux is all about <strong>possibility</strong> because we know that to succeed we need to innovate and change constantly. It's why we're called Flux, really. We think it's possible to challenge the status quo by delivering an exceptional energy experience. We think it's possible to build a product that makes people's lives simpler and better.</p>

At lunch, you can head out for a game of social soccer or netball, or stretch it out at a yoga class. Pool table and video games are upstairs in the open plan kitchen space. Our Friday Fives are a great way to connect with coworkers and unwind after the (long) week. During the year, we throw family-friendly events and activities, and our Christmas parties have been known to get a bit fancy.</p>
