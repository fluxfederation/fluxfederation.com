					<h2>Questions</h2>

					<h6 class="accordion">Who is Flux Federation?</h6>
					<div class="accordion">
						<p>Previously Powershop's technology and software development team, Flux is 100+ developers, designers, testers, product owners, agile coaches, doers and thinkers.</p>
						<p>Owned by Meridian Energy, and led by CEO Ari Sargent, we build the software that powers Powershop in New Zealand, Australia and the UK.</p>
					</div>

					<h6 class="accordion">What's changing?</h6>
					<div class="accordion">
						<p>The only real change you'll see is  our name. From 1 July 2017 the Powershop software development team changed - they are now known as Flux Federation Limited, or Flux for short. We're still the same people, doing the same great stuff.</p>
						<p>The electricity retail business will remain as Powershop New Zealand Limited.</p>
					</div>

					<br />
					<h5>Vendors working with Flux</h5>
					<h6 class="accordion">What can I expect?</h6>
					<div class="accordion">
						<p>We'll still be doing the same things together and you'll still be working with the same people. You'll see emails from a @fluxfederation.com domain and if you work with us we'll let you know when to start invoicing and be paid by Flux Federation.</p>
					</div>

					<h6 class="accordion">Do I still deal with [insert name of awesome Flux employee here]?</h6>
					<div class="accordion">
						<p>Yes.</p>
					</div>

					<h6 class="accordion">What happens to my contract?</h6>
					<div class="accordion">
						<p>For now, nothing. The same terms and conditions will apply. We'll be checking shortly if contracts need to be novated or remain in Powershop New Zealand Limited's name, and we'll be in touch if any changes are required.</p>
					</div>

					<h6 class="accordion">Who will pay me?</h6>
					<div class="accordion">
						<p>Flux exists from 1 July 2017. We'll be in touch to let you know if you need to change the entity that you invoice to Flux. If you don't hear from us, please continue to invoice Powershop New Zealand Limited as normal.</p>
					</div>

					<h6 class="accordion">What if I also work with the Powershop New Zealand retail business?</h6>
					<div class="accordion">
						<p>For now everything will remain the same. We'll be checking shortly if contracts need to be novated or remain in Powershop New Zealand Limited's name, and we'll be in touch if any changes are required. Where you work with both Flux and Powershop, it's likely that we'll look to split out contracts and/or payment details as contracts come up for renewal.</p>
					</div>

					<h6 class="accordion">Will there be a difference in how I deal with Powershop and Flux?</h6>
					<div class="accordion">
						<p>You may also continue to deal with Powershop retail contractually and Flux for production support or technical issues - but despite the change, you'll be dealing with the same people.</p>
					</div>

					<h6 class="accordion">What happens to payment terms?</h6>
					<div class="accordion">
						<p>They will stay the same.</p>
					</div>

					<h6 class="accordion">What are Flux's account details?</h6>
					<div class="accordion">
						<p>Until we notify you otherwise, Powershop New Zealand Limited will continue to be the entity that you will invoice, and that will pay you for services provided to one or both of Powershop New Zealand Limited and Flux Federation Limited.</p>
					</div>
