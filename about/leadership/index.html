Currently our Principal Product Manager, Jim has held such positions as Head of Product, Director of Client Services, UK Regional Manager, and Head of Operations. He's one of the key people who helped roll out the Powershop platform in New Zealand and Australia before we shipped him back to his homeland (the UK) to roll out of the platform in that market – to great success.
