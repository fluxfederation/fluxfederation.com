                            <p>Umesh was a Silver Medalled CommonWealth Games hockey star before he started his successful career in finance (he’s also competed in two Olympics too). With over 20 years experience and a BCA from Victoria University, Umesh worked in the audit and corporate finance teams at KPMG in Wellington before joining the Meridian Group in 2007. In 2012 he moved to Powershop, and joined Flux Federation as CFO, followed by COO. Flux has never been the same. Umesh brings a level-headedness, deep thought process, and financial strategy to an industry that is ever-changing. On any given day you'll find him managing stakeholder and board relationships, mitigating risk, and keeping an eagle eye on Flux's overall financial performance. Umesh has recently been appointed Flux Federation's Acting Chief Executive.</p>

His feet might be on his desk, but they're also firmly on the ground when it comes to making the right decisions to help grow our customers' businesses. After years as GM at Powershop and helping them win multiple awards across the world, Soper's philosophy is all about building elite teams that win. He's excited to get started with global domination, in fact he already has (but we can't tell you what just yet). His ruthless competitive streak and belief that execution and action beat ideas every single time, makes him a Flux force to be reckoned with.</p>

After graduating with a BSc in Computer Science, Mark headed to London for the classic Kiwi OE. He may have started his own bar in London, but he was no barfly. He quickly started work as a Java developer for small startups where he fell in love...with XP and Agile. Bupa, Lloyds, Capital One and Rabobank, have all benefited from the implementation of his Agile delivery models. In 2017, Mark returned to Wellington to help Westpac with a major agile transformation. We poached him soon after and he's been our Chief Technology Officer ever since. As a driving force in Flux's own transformation efforts, Mark is passionate about delivering beautifully designed engineering solutions that achieve our clients' business goals.</p>
