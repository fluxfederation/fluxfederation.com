From beer and electricity to voting systems and employment, she's delivered projects in New Zealand, Australia, the USA and UK. But wait, there's more. Jess was the Chief Revenue Officer at Flick Electric Co. for 5 years, and is the Founder and Managing Trustee of Cultivate Mentoring Lab, a not-for-profit that partners women with experienced mentors to help them grow their confidence and progress equally at work. Not one to rest on her laurels, Jessica has also served on the Board of PledgeMe, the National Council of Women, and is a mentor with start-up accelerator Creative HQ. Impressed? So are we – which is why we nabbed her.</p>
                                <p>Jess is known for bringing a customer centric mindset to the team along with years of energy experience, and marketing prowess. She's helped some of NZ's most significant organisations develop game changing ideas, brought them to life, and shared their stories, and will do the same for our clients. A self-described "klutz", she may spill a coffee or two on you during a meeting, but you'll be so dazzled by her brilliance, you won't even care.</p>
