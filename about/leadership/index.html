                        <p>Ari is founder and CEO of Flux Federation. He might dress like a washed up DJ, but over the past decade he has spearheaded the radical transformation in electricity retailing in New Zealand, Australia and the United Kingdom. An engineer with more than 25 years’ experience in the energy industry, Ari launched Powershop as a startup in 2009 after being frustrated with the industry’s legacy systems and outdated attitudes towards customers. A tech geek at heart, Ari saw a massive opportunity to use the flexibility, transparency, speed and lower cost structures offered by digital technologies to provide a fundamentally different (and better) experience for utility partners and their customers. Ari enjoys building power companies that customers love and with Flux Federation he is pursuing further partnerships to spread the love across international energy markets.</p>
